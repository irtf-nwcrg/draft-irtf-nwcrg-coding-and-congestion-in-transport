               Coding and congestion control in transport
               draft-irtf-nwcrg-coding-and-congestion-01

Abstract

   Coding is a reliability mechanism that is distinct and separated from
   the loss detection of congestion controls.  Using coding can be a
   useful way to better deal with tail losses or with networks with non-
   congestion losses.  However, coding mechanisms should not hide
   congestion signals.  This memo offers a discussion of how coding and
   congestion control can interact.

   This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network
   Communications Research Group (NWCRG).  The scope of the document is
   end-to-end communications: coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope of
   the document.

1.  Introduction

   There are cases where deploying coding improves the quality of the
   transmission.  As an example, it may take time for the server to
   detect tail losses and this would impact the experience of
   applications using short flows.  Another example are networks where
   non-congestion losses are persistent and prevent a sender from
   exploiting the link capacity.

   Coding is a reliability mechanism that is distinct and separated from
   the loss detection of congestion controls.  [RFC5681] defines TCP as
   a loss-based congestion control; because coding repairs such losses,
   blindly applying it may easily lead to an implementation that also
   hides a congestion signal to the sender.  It is important to ensure
   that such information hiding does not occur.

   This memo discusses how coding and congestion control mechanisms can
   coexist.  One objective is to help the research community consider
   congestion control aspects when proposing coding solutions.

   This document represents the collaborative work and consensus of the
   Coding for Efficient Network Communications Research Group (NWCRG);
   it is not an IETF product and is not a standard.  The proposed
   recommendations apply for coding at the transport or application
   layer.  Coding for tunnels is out of scope for the document.

2.  Separate channels, separate entities

   Figure 1 presents the notations that will be used in this document
   and introduce the Congestion Control (CC) and Forward Erasure
   Correction (FEC) channels.  The Congestion Control channel carries
   data packets (from a server to a client) and a potential information
   signaling the packets that have been received (from the client to the
   server).  The Forward Erasure Correction channel carries coded
   packets (from the server to the client) and a potiential information
   signaling the packets that have been repaired (from the client to the
   server).  It is worth pointing out that there are cases where these
   channels are not separated.

   Inside a host, the CC and FEC entities can be regarded as
   conceptually separate:

                        Figure 2: Separate entities

   As Figure 2 shows, the inputs to FEC (data to work upon, and
   signaling from the receiver about losses and/or repaired blocks) are
   distinct from the inputs to CC.  The latter calculates a sending rate
   or window from network measurements, and it takes the data to send as
   input, sometimes along with application requirements such as upper/
   lower rate bounds, periods of quiescence, or a priority.

   It is not clear that the ACK signals feeding into a congestion
   control algorithm are useful to FEC in their raw form, and vice versa
   - information about repaired blocks may be quite irrelevant to a CC
   algorithm.  However, there can be meaningful other interactions
   (indicated by the horizontal double arrow) between the two entities,
   usually as a result of their operation rather than by relaying their
   own raw inputs.  For example, the network measurements carried out by
   CC can yield a longer-term statistical measure such as a loss ratio
   which is useful input for a FEC coding scheme.  Similarly, unequal
   error protection using fountain codes can be used to assign different
   priorities to blocks of data, and these priorities can be honored by
   a CC mechanism.

3.  Scope

   This section describes the scope of the document.

3.1.  Type of application

   The document focuses on reliable transmissions.

3.2.  End-to-end

   The document focuses on end-to-end coding, i.e. cases where coding is
   added at the server and client end points.  The discussions should
   then consider fairness with non-coding solutions.

3.3.  Objective of the document

   Section 2 presents that FEC and CC can be seen as two separate
   channels.  In practice, implementations may mix the signals that are
   exchanged on these channels.  This document discusses how FEC and CC
   relate.  [NK: We may want to later add that we provide
   recommendations - but for the moment, we may just list the server
   side coding solutions in the layering approach without providing
   recommendations for each case]

   The coded packets are sent within what the congestion window allows,
   such as in [CTCP].  Examples of the solution would be sending coded
   packets when there is no more data to transmit or preferably send
   coded packets instead of the following packets in the send buffer.

   The coded packets are sent on top of what is allowed by the
   congestion control.  Examples of the solution could be adding a given
   percentage of the congestion window as supplementary packets or
   sending a given amount of coded packets at a given rate.  The

   redundancy flow can be decorrelated from the congestion control that
   manages source packets: a secondary congestion control can be
   introduced, such as in coupled congestion control for RTP media
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-coupled-cc].  An example would be to exploit a lower
   than best-effort congestion control [RFC6297].
