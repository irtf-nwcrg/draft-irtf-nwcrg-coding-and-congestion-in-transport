    <abstract>
        <t>FEC coding is a reliability mechanism that is distinct and separated from the loss detection of congestion controls. Using FEC coding can be a useful way to better deal with transfer tail losses or with networks with non-congestion losses. However, FEC coding mechanisms should not hide congestion signals. This memo offers a discussion of how FEC coding and congestion control can coexist. This document can help the comparison of FEC schemes by identifying at which level they are operating with respect to the transport congestion control.</t>
        <t>This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications Research Group (NWCRG). The scope of the document is end-to-end communications: FEC coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope of the document.</t>

    <section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">
	<t>There are cases where deploying FEC coding improves the quality of the transmission. As an example, when a server transmits data to a client it may take time for the server to detect tail losses (i.e. ) and this would impact the experience of applications using short flows. Another example are networks where non-congestion losses are persistent and prevent a sender from exploiting the link capacity.</t>
	<t>Coding is a reliability mechanism that is distinct and separated from the loss detection of congestion controls. <xref target="RFC5681"/> defines TCP as a loss-based congestion control; because FEC coding repairs such losses, blindly applying it may easily lead to an implementation that also hides a congestion signal to the sender. It is important to ensure that such information hiding does not occur.</t>
        <t>This memo offers a discussion of how FEC coding and congestion control can coexist. Another objective is to encourage the research community to also consider congestion control aspects when proposing and comparing FEC coding solutions in communication systems. That being said, this document does not aim at proposing FEC coding solutions characterization guidelines: comparing FEC Schemes without considering congestion control can be relevant if the goal is to compare those schemes only.</t>
        <t>This document represents the collaborative work and consensus of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications Research Group (NWCRG); it is not an IETF product and is not a standard. The proposed recommendations apply for FEC coding at the transport or application layer. Coding for tunnels is out of scope for the document.</t>

        <section anchor="sec:notations" title="Separate channels, separate entities">
        <t><xref target="fig:sep-channel"></xref> presents the notations that will be used in this document and introduce the Congestion Control (CC) and Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) channels. The Congestion Control channel carries data packets (from a server to a client) and potential information signaling the packets that have been received (from the client to the server). The Forward Erasure Correction channel carries coded packets (from the server to the client) and a potiential information signaling the packets that have been repaired (from the client to the server). It is worth pointing out that there are cases where these channels are not separated.</t>

	<t><xref target="fig:sep-entities"></xref> provides more details than 
	<xref target="fig:sep-channel"></xref> by focusing on the server side. 
	The inputs to FEC (data to work upon, and signaling 
	from the receiver about losses and/or repaired blocks)
        are distinct from the inputs to CC. The latter calculates a
        sending rate or window from network measurements, and it takes
        the data to send as input, sometimes along with application requirements
        such as upper/lower rate bounds, periods of quiescence, or a priority.</t>

        <t> It is not clear that the ACK signals feeding into a congestion control
            algorithm are useful to FEC in their raw form, and vice versa - information
            about repaired blocks may be quite irrelevant to a CC algorithm. However,
            there can be meaningful other interactions (indicated by the horizontal double arrow)
            between the two entities, usually as a result of their operation rather than
	    by relaying their own raw inputs. <!-- For example, the network measurements carried
            out by CC can yield a longer-term statistical measure such as a loss ratio
            which is useful input for a FEC coding scheme. Similarly, unequal error
            protection using fountain codes can be used to assign different priorities
	    to blocks of data, and these priorities can be honored by a CC mechanism. --> </t>

This document discusses how FEC and CC relate. The discussion can help in avoiding comparing FEC schemes that do not operate at the same level (with respect to the CC).
